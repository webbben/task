	Short: "task management CLI tool",
	Long: `CLI tool to let you manage your tasks more efficiently! add new tasks, view them, delete them, sort them, etc.
Basic examples:

# show all ongoing tasks
task list

# add task
task add "write some code"`,
	// Uncomment the following line if your bare application
	// has an action associated with it:
	// Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) { },
}

// Execute adds all child commands to the root command and sets flags appropriately.
// This is called by main.main(). It only needs to happen once to the rootCmd.
func Execute() {
	err := rootCmd.Execute()
	if err != nil {
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}

func init() {
	rootCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
